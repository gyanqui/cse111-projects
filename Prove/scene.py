You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on Tuesday
Write a Python program that draws a semi-realistic outdoor scene
in a computer window. Your program can draw any outdoor scene that 
you like as long as it meets these requirements:

The scene must be outdoor and include part of the sky.
The sky must have clouds.
The scene must include repetitive objects, such as blades of grass, 
trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in 
a fence, dashed lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, 
snowflakes, or icicles.
Your program must be divided into functions such as draw_sky, 
draw_cloud, draw_ground, draw_bird, draw_flower, draw_insect, 
draw_fish, or draw_snowman.
Each of the objects in your scene should be drawn in its own 
function. To draw the shapes in the scene, your program will call 
functions in a Python library named Draw 2-D.
