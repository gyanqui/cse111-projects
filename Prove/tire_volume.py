Purpose: Calculate the volume of space inside a tire in the USA and add store user
inputs to a txt file. 
"""
"""
Write a program named tire_volume.py that computes the approximate volume of air 
inside a tire. Add code near the end of that program that does the following:

Gets the current date from the computer’s operating system.
Opens a text file named volumes.txt for appending.
Appends to the end of the volumes.txt file one line of text that contains the 
following five values:
    current date
    width of the tire
    aspect ratio of the tire
    diameter of the wheel
    volume of the tire
