"""write a Python program named esteem.py that implements the Rosenberg
self-esteem scale. Your program must ask the user to respond to each of
the ten statements with D, d, a, or A which mean strongly disagree, disagree,
agree, and strongly agree. Your program must compute the score for each
answer and sum and display the person’s total score. You should think
about how you will separate this program into functions before you begin
writing the program.
