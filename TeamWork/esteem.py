"""write a Python program named esteem.py that implements the Rosenberg
self-esteem scale. Your program must ask the user to respond to each of
the ten statements with D, d, a, or A which mean strongly disagree, disagree,
agree, and strongly agree. Your program must compute the score for each
answer and sum and display the personâ€™s total score. You should think
about how you will separate this program into functions before you begin
writing the program.
