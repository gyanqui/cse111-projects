Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

During a team assignment in week 4, I recognized the benefits of using functions in programming when developing the can_size.py
program. Dividing a program into smaller, single-task functions enhances its organization and helps ensure each step executes as
intended. This technique improves code readability, modularity, and reusability, leading to more efficient programming practices.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are an important tool for ensuring that our code works as intended. They allow us to check that our functions
are returning the expected output for a given input, and help us catch errors or bugs in our code. By writing and running
test functions regularly, we can build more robust and reliable software that is less likely to break or fail in unexpected ways.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When troubleshooting and fixing a program, I typically start by identifying the specific issue or error that is occurring. This might
involve looking at error messages or examining the output of the code to see where things are going wrong. From there, I try to isolate
the problem by breaking the code down into smaller parts or testing different input values to see where the issue occurs. Once I have
identified the root cause of the problem, I can make changes to the code to fix the issue and re-test the program to ensure that it is
working correctly.

One thing that can help improve this process is to use debugging tools, such as a debugger or print statements, to get more insight
into what is happening in the code. Additionally, writing clear and descriptive comments throughout the code can make it easier to
understand what each part of the program is doing and help identify where errors might be occurring.
